Since their appearance in literature, GANs have been successfully applied to problems of image generation, editing and semi-supervised learning \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/RadfordMC15} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ZhangXLZHWM16}. \textit{The results obtained with this technique were so good that they captured the attention of a great number of researchers, leading to a proliferation of various flavors of GAN, each performing better than the others on a specific domain.} It's difficult anyway to understand how to compare different GAN models, because of the lack of a consistent metric and the different architectures with which networks can be designed, which for each project are related to the corresponding computational budget. A tentative to define some guidelines to avoid these problems, together with a fair and comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art GANs, is discussed in \cite{46506}[MISSING ACCENTS ON REF]. From there it can be evinced that there is no variation to the original GAN model that really improve the performances on a neutral field. Thus we present here a formalization of the original problem \cite{NIPS2014_5423}, modeling it with a game theory approach in a more precise way, as partially done in \cite{2017arXiv171200679O}.

Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) can be naturally represented as a 2-player zero-sum game:
